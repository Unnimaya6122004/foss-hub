### üîß Adding New Tools

We love expanding our directory with quality FOSS tools! Here's how to add a new tool:

#### Prerequisites for Tool Submission

- [ ] Tool must be genuinely open source (OSI-approved license)
- [ ] Active development (commits within last 6 months)
- [ ] Stable release available (not alpha/beta only)
- [ ] Clear documentation
- [ ] No malicious code or privacy concerns
- [ ] Provides real value to users

#### How to Add a Tool

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-tool-toolname
   ```

2. **Edit the tools data file** at `src/data/tools.js`:
   ```javascript
   {
     id: 'unique-tool-id', // lowercase, hyphenated
     name: 'Tool Name',
     description: 'Concise description (max 160 chars) explaining what the tool does',
     longDescription: 'Detailed description with key features and use cases',
     category: 'Development', // Must match existing categories
     subcategory: 'IDE', // Optional
     url: 'https://official-website.com',
     github: 'https://github.com/org/repo',
     gitlab: 'https://gitlab.com/org/repo', // If applicable
     docs: 'https://docs-website.com',
     tags: ['editor', 'code', 'development'],
     logo: '/images/tools/tool-logo.svg', // SVG preferred
     screenshots: [
       '/images/tools/tool-screenshot-1.png',
       '/images/tools/tool-screenshot-2.png'
     ],
     platforms: ['Windows', 'macOS', 'Linux', 'Web'],
     license: 'MIT',
     lastUpdate: '2024-01-15',
     version: '3.2.1',
     alternatives: ['alternative-tool-id-1', 'alternative-tool-id-2'],
     featured: false, // Set to true only for exceptional tools
     stats: {
       stars: 45000,
       forks: 3200,
       contributors: 580
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Add tool assets**:
   - Logo: Add to `/public/images/tools/` (SVG preferred, PNG fallback)
   - Screenshots: Add to `/public/images/tools/` (optimize for web, max 500KB each)
   - Ensure images are properly licensed or use official assets

4. **Test your addition**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Verify the tool appears correctly
   # Check all links work
   # Ensure filtering works
   ```

5. **Submit a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear PR title: `Add [Tool Name] to directory`

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Types
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)

```

### JavaScript Style Guide

We use ESLint with the following key rules:

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good
const toolName = 'Visual Studio Code';
const tools = [...existingTools, newTool];

function getToolById(id) {
  return tools.find(tool => tool.id === id);
}

// Component naming (React)
const ToolCard = ({ tool }) => {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <div className="tool-card">
      {/* Content */}
    </div>
  );
};

// ‚ùå Bad
var tool_name = "Visual Studio Code"
let Tools = existingTools.concat([newTool])

function get_tool_by_id(id){
  for(let i=0;i<tools.length;i++){
    if(tools[i].id==id) return tools[i]
  }
}
```

### CSS/Tailwind Style Guide

```css
/* Use Tailwind utilities first */
<div className="flex items-center justify-between p-4 bg-gray-900 rounded-lg">

/* Custom CSS when necessary */
.tool-card {
  /* Use CSS variables for consistency */
  background: var(--card-background);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-color);
  
  /* Mobile-first approach */
  padding: 1rem;
  
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    padding: 1.5rem;
  }
}

/* Naming conventions */
.component-name { }        /* Component */
.component-name__element { } /* Element */
.component-name--modifier { } /* Modifier */
```
